# 📊 E-commerce Customer Trends Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer behavior and sales trends** for an e-commerce platform using **SQL, Python and Power BI**. The goal is to uncover actionable insights related to customer demographics, product performance, subscription behavior, and purchasing patterns to support data-driven business decisions.

An interactive dashboard was developed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and enable stakeholders to explore data dynamically through filters and slicers.
